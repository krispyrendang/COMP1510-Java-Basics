/**
 * Indicate whether each name below is a legal identifier, and if so, 
 * whether it is a good choice to name our program. If the answer to either question is no, explain why.
 * 
 * 1. simple - illegal identifier. Same name as the main method but with different case.
 * 
 * 2. SimpleProgram - Yes. Yes, good choice for a name.
 * 
 * 3. 1 Simple - illegal identifier. Name cannot start with a digit.
 * 
 * 4. _Simple_ - Yes. Not a great choice, since the _ does not have a significant meaning.
 * 
 * 5. *Simple* - illegal identifier. Name cannot contain the * character.
 * 
 * 6. $123_45 - Yes. No, Java conventions do not usually include $ character in the name.
 * 
 * 7. Simple! - illegal identifier. Name cannot contain the ! character.
